## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- JDK 17 (both Java 8 and 11 also supported), Node.js v18 or above
- Docker installed in your machine and postgres v15.3 or above running in a container.

## Getting Started

To get this project up and running, follow the steps below for both the backend (Spring Framework) and frontend (React) components.

### Backend (Spring Framework)

#### To get running backend:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/msbeigiai/spring-full-stack.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the backend directory:
   ```bash
    cd spring-full-stack
    ```
   to run the application there are 2 alternative ways:
    - 1. running each one individually
    - 2. or by deploying to docker hub and running _docker compose_. \
*I suggest the second option because both backend and frontend will run in a single command*
3. Navigate to the backend folder and run:
    ```bash
   mvn clean deploy jib:build
   ```
   this command will deploy the latest backend in Docker hub and later can be run in `docker compose`.

### Frontend (React)
#### To get running frontend:
1. Navigate back to frontend, then navigate to react folder and run:
    ```bach
   cd ../frontend/react
   docker build . -t msbeigiai/msbeigi-react
   docker push msbeigiai/msbeigi-react
    ```
   this will also push latest version of frontend into Docker hub.
2. To boot up the entire project navigate back to the project root and then run docker compose command:
    ```bash
   cd spring-boot-example/
   docker compose up -d
    ```

### Configuration
1. In case you see error booting up backend just navigate inside `postgres` database by running:
```bash
docker exec -it postgres bash
```
and then run:
```bash
psql -U msbeigi
```
while you are prompted for password, supply `password`.\
inside postgres database create `customer` database by writing:
```sql
CREATE DATABASE customer;
```
by now your application must be up and running.

### Usage
By configuring the project as above guidelines, project can run perfectly.
